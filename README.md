**Car-Price-Prediction**

This repository explores machine learning techniques to predict used car prices. It delves into data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation to build an accurate pricing model.

**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a robust model for predicting used car prices. It involves:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Understanding the dataset's features and their impact on car prices.
   - Analyzing data distributions and identifying potential relationships.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features or transforming existing ones to extract valuable insights.
   - Handling missing values and categorical data appropriately.
3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Selecting suitable regression models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
   - Training the chosen model(s) on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Employing cross-validation techniques to assess model robustness and prevent overfitting.

**Pro Tips**

- Consider ensemble methods like Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression for potentially higher accuracy.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Car-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies (replace `<package>` with actual package names):
   ```bash
   pip install <package1> <package2> ...
   ```
3. Explore the code in the `src` directory:
   - `data_exploration.py`: Explores and analyzes car price data.
   - `feature_engineering.py`: Creates or transforms features.
   - `model_selection.py`: Selects and trains regression models.
   - `model_evaluation.py`: Evaluates model performance.

4. Run the scripts to execute the project steps. Refer to individual script comments for specific instructions.

**Dataset**

This project requires a dataset containing used car information with features like model year, mileage, make, model, transmission type, etc. The target variable should be the car's selling price. You can find publicly available used car datasets online.

**Contribution**

Feel free to contribute by:

- Forking the repository.
- Implementing additional features or models.
